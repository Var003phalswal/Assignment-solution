This is the Pupil Bio Scientist test assignment it has two tasks.
Task 1: Data Handling and Statistical Analysis: Coverage Analysis:
a. Calculate the median and CV for single CpG coverage
in each tissue.
b. Generate plots summarizing the coverage statistics.
2. Biomarker Identification:
a. Identify PMPs with high specificity for tissue differentiation, minimizing false
positives for Tissue #1 while allowing some false negatives. Use statistical or
machine learning approaches to assign confidence p-values to each PMP.
b. Calculate the mean VRF for each PMP in both tissues.

3. Address the following questions :
a. How does sequencing depth affect specificity confidence? 
b. For the top 10 PMPs, estimate the threshold of reads required to confidently
call Tissue #2 at a sequencing depth of 1 million reads. 
c. Validate the hypothesis by comparing the specificity of the top 10 PMPs
against individual CpG sites.
The solution of these steps for task 1 has all in one .py file.
Task 2: parts are solved based on the Fastaqc,samtool, GATK, and Mutect2 use and draw the solutions.
